Given the provided data snippets, it appears that the full and structured input format with all necessary fields is still missing. To proceed correctly, I need the following structured JSON format:

{
  "repo_owner": "example_owner",
  "repo_name": "example_repo",
  "branch": "main",
  "epics": [
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-001",
      "epic_name": "Add Product to Shopping Cart"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-002",
      "epic_name": "Remove Product from Shopping Cart"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-003",
      "epic_name": "Modify Quantity of Products in Shopping Cart"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-004",
      "epic_name": "Save Shopping Cart for Logged-in Users"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-005",
      "epic_name": "User Registration"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-006",
      "epic_name": "User Login"
    }
  ],
  "tech_stack": "Django",
  "database": "mysql",
  "session_id": "your_unique_session_id"
}

Once you provide the required data in this structured format including `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `branch`, details of `epics`, `tech_stack`, `database`, and `session_id`, I can proceed to generate the backend folder structure for you.

Please provide the full and structured JSON data.
