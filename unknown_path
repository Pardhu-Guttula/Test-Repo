Please provide the necessary details in the following structured format to generate the backend folder structure for you:

{
  "repo_owner": "your_repo_owner",
  "repo_name": "your_repo_name",
  "branch": "main",
  "epics": [
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-001",
      "epic_name": "Add Product to Shopping Cart"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-002",
      "epic_name": "Remove Product from Shopping Cart"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-003",
      "epic_name": "Modify Quantity of Products in Shopping Cart"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-004",
      "epic_name": "Save Shopping Cart for Logged-in Users"
    },
    {
      "epic_id": "EPIC-005",
      "epic_name": "User Registration"
    }
  ],
  "tech_stack": "Django",
  "database": "mysql",
  "session_id": "your_unique_session_id"
}

Please replace the placeholder values with your actual data for `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `branch`, epic details, `tech_stack`, `database`, and `session_id`. Once you provide the data in this structured format, I can generate the backend folder structure for you.
